    script: `Hi [Parent Name], I wanted to share what I observed with [Child Name] today. During our transition to cleanup time, [he/she] had some big feelings and needed extra support to feel calm again. This is completely normal for children [his/her] age - their brains are still learning how to handle disappointment and changes. What I saw was [Child Name] working hard to express [his/her] feelings, even though it came out as crying and frustration. We stayed close, helped [him/her] take some deep breaths, and [he/she] was able to rejoin the group when ready. These moments are actually opportunities for [him/her] to practice emotional skills that will serve [him/her] well throughout life.`,

During playtime, [he/she] bit [peer/adult] when [he/she] was feeling frustrated about sharing a toy. I know this can be concerning, but biting is actually very common for toddlers and young children. At this age, [Child Name]'s language skills are still developing, and sometimes [his/her] body tries to communicate what [his/her] words can't yet express. We immediately helped [him/her] understand that biting hurts friends, and we practiced using words like "my turn" instead. We're working on giving [him/her] the tools to express [his/her] needs in ways that keep everyone safe.`,

This kind of behavior often shows us that a child is processing their environment or might be feeling overwhelmed. [Child Name] is naturally thoughtful and observant - these are wonderful strengths. We made sure [he/she] felt safe and supported, and when [he/she] was ready, [he/she] gradually joined in. Some children need more time to warm up, and that's perfectly okay. We're here to support [his/her] natural rhythm while gently encouraging participation when [he/she] feels comfortable.`,

[He/She] really knows what [he/she] wants and isn't easily swayed - this shows incredible inner strength that will serve [him/her] well in life. Sometimes this determination shows up as resistance during transitions, like when we're moving from free play to circle time. [His/Her] strong will means [he/she] gets deeply engaged in activities, which is wonderful for learning and focus. We're working on helping [him/her] use that same determination to practice flexibility. We give [him/her] advance notice about changes and choices within the transition, which honors [his/her] need for some control while still moving the day forward.`,

When children feel stressed, scared, or overwhelmed, their bodies have automatic responses - just like adults do. [Child Name]'s brain is still learning how to manage these big feelings, and that's completely normal. What might look like "misbehavior" is often [his/her] nervous system trying to feel safe again. Today when [situation], [his/her] body went into protection mode. We helped [him/her] feel safe by [specific actions], and once [his/her] nervous system calmed down, [he/she] was able to think clearly again.
